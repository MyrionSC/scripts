"> file" means redirect stdout to file. stout is meant because it is the default stream when none is specified by number.
"2> file" means redirect stderr to file
">&2" means redirect stdout to stderr (default stream)
"1>&2" means redirect stdout to stderr
"2>&1" means redirect stderr to stdout
"&> file" means redirect stdout and stderr to file, however this only works in newer shells, like bash 4 onwards
"> /dev/null 2>&1" hide every output
"&> /dev/null" hide every output (bash 4+)


# nmap scan for devices on network
in ifconfig look for inet addr in wlan0 (wireless) or eth0 (wired), eg: inet addr:192.168.1.91
sudo nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24, which basically scans from 192.168.1.0 to 192.168.1.255
