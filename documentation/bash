"> file" means redirect stdout to file. stout is meant because it is the default stream when none is specified by number.
"2> file" means redirect stderr to file
">&2" means redirect stdout to stderr (default stream)
"1>&2" means redirect stdout to stderr
"2>&1" means redirect stderr to stdout
"&> file" means redirect stdout and stderr to file, however this only works in newer shells, like bash 4 onwards
"> /dev/null 2>&1" hide every output
"&> /dev/null" hide every output (bash 4+)

bash creates 3 streams when calling command: stdin, stdout and stderr
- stdin is input to function. It can be captured in variable: var=$(cat)
- stdout is where data is going
- stderr is any errors produced by script

# hidden chars (like lineendings)
- print hidden chars: echo $var | cat -v
- remove hidden chars: echo $var | tr -d 'HIDDEN_VAR' # fx. 

sed -e 's/^.//' -e 's/.$//' # remove first and last char from string piped in

# bind
- bind help: bind --help
- see currently bound functions: bind -P
- bind function func to ctrl-e: bind '"\C-e": func'

# test if file exists
if [ -f /tmp/foo.txt ]; then
    echo "File not found!"
fi
shorthand file not exists: [ ! -f /tmp/foo.txt ] && echo "File not found!"
