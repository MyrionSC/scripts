---- Optimize
Run explain analyse some_query and find the slowest parts of query. Try to index it. Run it again to see if works.

gui to analyze: https://explain.depesz.com/s/3TNb#stats

Analyze causes command to be run, so for commands that change something, like UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE etc. use rollback:

BEGIN;
EXPLAIN ANALYZE ...;
ROLLBACK;
