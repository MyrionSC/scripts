### Reverse proxy
send request to some service running on a port and return response, while not changing any headers

location /endpoint {
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080;
}


### Configure longer log rotation and how long you keep logs
1. cd /etc/logrotate.d/
2. vim nginx and change daily -> weekly and change rotate value


### Generate monitoring report from nginx logs
1. Install goaccess: apt install goaccess
2. navigate to nginx logs dir (probably /var/log/nginx)
3. compile all the access logs: zcat access*.gz > compiled_access.txt && cat access.log.1 >> compiled_access.txt && cat access.log >> compiled_access.txt
    3.1 If you want to only see for some site: cat compiled_access.txt | grep somesite > somesite.log
4. To generate report: goaccess compiled_access.txt -o nginx_report.html --log-format=COMBINED
5. mv nginx_report.html somewhere in webroot so can access from outside
