systemd has 12 unit types. .service is system services, and when you’re running any of the above commands you can leave off the .service extension, because systemd assumes a service unit if you don’t specify something else. The other unit types are:

Target: group of units
Automount: filesystem auto-mountpoint
Device: kernel device names, which you can see in sysfs and udev
Mount: filesystem mountpoint
Path: file or directory
Scope: external processes not started by systemd
Slice: a management unit of processes
Snapshot: systemd saved state
Socket: IPC (inter-process communication) socket
Swap: swap file
Timer: systemd timer.
